# Exercise 0 - Prepare your development environment

In this exercise, we will connect an UI5 app running on SAP BTP to an SAP S/4HANA Cloud system running on Microsoft Azure.

## Exercise 0.1: Get the code for this session into VS Code

1. Open the [GitHub repository for XP160](https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2023-XP160).

2. Click on the `Code` button, switch to the `Codespaces` tab and click on the button `Create codespace for ...`.

    This will take a few minutes. Be patient :-)

4. Once all is done, you are in your Codespace.

    > **Note** - GitHub codespaces are free for a certain amount of time per month. For the hands-on session the free time is more than enough. **Don't forget to delete your codespace again after the hands-on session!**

## Exercise 0.2: get the ID of your subaccount

1. Get the credentials from the instructor of this hands-on session

    You will get the username and your password from the session instructors. Each participant will get access to one BTP subaccount.

2. Open the [SAP BTP global account for XP160](https://emea.cockpit.btp.cloud.sap/cockpit/#/globalaccount/a0ab1ce3-9dab-48b8-9122-524f7fde1f28/) in a **new tab** of your web browser.
    You will have to use the credentials provided to you by the instructors.
