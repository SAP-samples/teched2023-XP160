# Exercise 0 - Prepare your development environment

## Exercise 0.1: Get the code for this session into VS Code

We will use GitHub [Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/overview) as integrated development environment for this workshop. Access the Codespace following these steps:

1. Open the [GitHub repository for XP160](https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2023-XP160).

2. Click on the `Code` button, switch to the `Codespaces` tab and click on the button `Create codespace for ...`.

    This will take a few minutes. Be patient ðŸ™‚

4. Once all is done, you are in your Codespace.

    > **Note** - GitHub codespaces are free for a certain amount of time per month. For the hands-on session the free time is more than enough. **Don't forget to delete your codespace again after the hands-on session!**

## Exercise 0.2: Get the ID of your SAP BTP subaccount

1. Get the credentials (username and password) from the instructor of this hands-on session. Each participant will get access to one SAP BTP subaccount.

2. Open the [SAP BTP global account for XP160](https://emea.cockpit.btp.cloud.sap/cockpit/#/globalaccount/a0ab1ce3-9dab-48b8-9122-524f7fde1f28/) in a **new tab** of your web browser. You will have to use the credentials provided to you by the instructors.
